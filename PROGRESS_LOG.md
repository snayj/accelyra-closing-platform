- âœ… Set up project structure (backend/, frontend/, scripts/, tests/)
- âœ… Installed all Python dependencies (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Streamlit, etc.)
- âœ… Made key technical decisions (SQLite now, PostgreSQL-ready, Tesseract OCR, Streamlit)
- âœ… Created database.py (connection setup, session management)
- âœ… Created Transaction model with workflow fields (earnest money, funds verification, stage history)
- âœ… Created Party model (buyers, sellers, agents, lenders, etc.)
- âœ… Created Document model (OCR, validation, audit trail)
- âœ… Created Task model (action items, dependencies, blocking logic)
- âœ… Created database initialization script
- âœ… Successfully created SQLite database with all tables
- âœ… Implemented 7-stage state machine with history logging and automatic task generation
- âœ… Created FastAPI main application with comprehensive logging
- âœ… Built complete Transaction API (CRUD + workflows)
- âœ… Built Party API (create, list, get parties)
- âœ… Built Task API (list, complete tasks)
- âœ… Implemented workflow endpoints (earnest money, funds verification, stage advancement)
- âœ… End-to-end API testing - full transaction journey tested successfully
- âœ… Comprehensive logging throughout entire transaction lifecycle

**Current Focus**: Interactive workflow demonstration complete!

**Latest Updates (Session 2)**:
- [âœ…] Dashboard rebuilt with better design (user feedback addressed)
- [âœ…] Interactive workflow actions added to Transaction Detail page
- [âœ…] Complete tasks functionality (with notes)
- [âœ…] Process earnest money deposit workflow
- [âœ…] Verify buyer funds workflow
- [âœ…] Advance transaction stage workflow
- [âœ…] Real-time API call execution and results display
- [âœ…] Built-in API documentation in dashboard
- [âœ…] Auto-refresh after actions
- [âœ…] Updated all documentation (DASHBOARD_README.md, DEMO_READY.md)

**Next Steps**:
- [âœ…] Generate seed data for demo scenarios - COMPLETE
- [âœ…] Build Streamlit dashboard (Phase 4) - COMPLETE
- [âœ…] Add interactive workflow triggers - COMPLETE
- [ ] Document processing pipeline (Phase 2) - Future
- [ ] Mock external services (Phase 3) - Future

**Seed Data Created**:
- âœ… 22 parties (buyers, sellers, agents, lenders, title officers)
- âœ… 6 transaction scenarios covering all stages
- âœ… Realistic tasks, history, and timeline for each transaction
- âœ… Scenarios: fast track, smooth progress, just started, delayed, completed, high-value

## Technical Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale | Date |
|----------|--------|-----------|------|
| Database | SQLite | Portability for demo, easier local testing | 2025-10-30 |
| OCR Service | Tesseract | Open source, free, runs locally, good for learning | 2025-10-30 |
| Frontend | Streamlit | Pure Python, fastest to build, minimal JS needed | 2025-10-30 |
| E-signature | Generate mock PDFs with signature fields | Create realistic process: generate docs that can be signed/proxied | 2025-10-30 |

## Learning Notes

**Key Concepts to Understand**:
- State machines in Python (python-statemachine library)
- SQLAlchemy ORM patterns
- FastAPI async patterns
- Document validation workflows

---

## Questions for User

1. **OCR Service**: Start with Tesseract (free) or AWS Textract (better quality)?
2. **Frontend**: Streamlit (fastest to build) or React (more polished)?
3. **E-signature**: Should we show native capability or assume documents arrive pre-signed?
