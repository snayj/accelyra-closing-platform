**Goal**: Establish transaction workflow and data structures

**Deliverables**:
- Transaction state machine with 7 closing stages
- PostgreSQL schema for transactions, documents, parties, tasks
- Basic CRUD API endpoints for transactions
- Seed data: 3-5 sample transactions at different stages

**Key Components**:
```
/backend
  /models
    - transaction.py (purchase details, status, timeline)
    - document.py (uploaded files, validation status)
    - party.py (buyer, seller, agent, lender profiles)
    - task.py (action items, assignments, deadlines)

- Validation rules engine (check completeness, accuracy, signatures)
- Document status dashboard (pending/approved/rejected)

**Key Components**:
```
/backend
  /services
    - document_classifier.py (use GPT-4V or keyword matching)
    - ocr_service.py (Tesseract wrapper or Textract client)
    - validator.py (rules engine)
    - signature_detector.py (OpenCV-based signature presence check)
  /validation_rules

      "description": "Purchase price matches transaction",
      "field": "purchase_price",
      "validation": "equals",
      "compare_to": "transaction.purchase_price",
      "severity": "critical"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Sample Data Requirements**:
- 10-15 PDF templates for each document type
- Script to generate filled PDFs with dummy data
- Mix of valid and invalid documents (missing signatures, wrong amounts, etc.)

---

### Phase 3: Mock Integration Services (Week 2-3)

**Goal**: Simulate external institution APIs with realistic delays

**Deliverables**:
- Title company service (search, report generation)
- Lender verification service (credit check, underwriting)
- Escrow service (account creation, fund tracking)
- County recorder service (deed recording)
- Each service returns realistic JSON responses with artificial delays

**Key Components**:
```
/mock_services
  /title_company
    - app.py (Flask API)
    - title_search endpoint (POST: property address, returns liens/status)
  /lender
    - app.py
    - verify_funds endpoint (POST: borrower info, returns approval/conditions)
  /escrow
    - app.py
    - create_account endpoint
    - wire_transfer endpoint (tracks fund movement)
  /recorder
    - app.py
    - record_deed endpoint (returns recording number)
```

**Realistic Delays** (to simulate processing time):
- Title search: 2-3 days traditional → 4 hours on platform (use time.sleep in demo)
- Lender underwriting: 5-7 days → 24 hours
- Recording: 1-2 days → 6 hours

**API Response Examples**:
```json
// Title Search Response
{
  "transaction_id": "TS-2024-12345",
  "property_address": "123 Maple St, Springfield, IL 62701",
  "status": "clear",
  "liens": [],
  "encumbrances": [],
  "legal_description": "Lot 15, Block 3, Maple Grove Subdivision",
  "completed_at": "2024-10-29T14:30:00Z",
  "estimated_completion": "2024-10-30T09:00:00Z"
}

// Lender Verification Response
{
  "verification_id": "LV-2024-67890",
  "borrower_name": "John Doe",
  "loan_amount": 360000,
  "status": "approved_with_conditions",
  "conditions": ["Verify employment within 10 days of closing"],
  "expiration_date": "2024-12-15",
  "completed_at": "2024-10-28T16:45:00Z"
}
```

**Sample Data Requirements**:
- 20 property records with title history
- 15 borrower profiles with credit scores
- Mock bank account data for escrow tracking

---

### Phase 4: Dashboard & Timeline Visualization (Week 3)

**Goal**: Create investor-facing demo interface

**Deliverables**:
- Transaction list view (all active closings)
- Transaction detail view (timeline, documents, parties, tasks)
- Document management interface (upload, review status)
- Comparison view: traditional timeline vs platform timeline
- Metrics dashboard (time savings, cost reduction, error rates)

**Key Screens**:

1. **Overview Dashboard**
   - Active transactions by stage (bar chart)
   - Average days to close metric
   - Recent activity feed
   - Alerts/exceptions needing attention

2. **Transaction Timeline** (Gantt chart style)
   - Visual progress bar showing current stage
   - Completed stages (green checkmarks)
   - In-progress stages (yellow, with estimated completion)
   - Upcoming stages (gray)
   - Parallel workflows highlighted (e.g., title search + appraisal happening simultaneously)

3. **Document Center**
   - Grid view of all required documents
   - Status indicators: pending/uploaded/validating/approved/rejected
   - Click to view validation results
   - Upload button with drag-and-drop

4. **Comparison View** (Side-by-Side)
   - Left: Traditional sequential process (45 days, manual steps)
   - Right: Platform accelerated process (13 days, automated validations)
   - Highlight time saved at each stage

**Metrics to Display**:
- Average days to close: Traditional (42) vs Platform (13)
- Manual review hours eliminated: 47 → 12 per transaction
- Error rate: 8% → 0.5%
- Cost per transaction: $2,800 → $950

**Sample Data Requirements**:
- Historical transaction data showing improvement trend
- Simulated real-time status updates

### Phase 5: Exception Handling & Edge Cases (Week 4)

**Goal**: Demonstrate platform handles real-world complications

**Deliverables**:
- Title defect discovered scenario (lien on property)
- Document rejection workflow (missing signature)
- Funding delay scenario (wire transfer hold)
- Re-routing logic when issues arise
- Notification system (email/SMS alerts)

**Demo Scenarios**:

1. **Title Issue Discovered**
   - Title search returns unexpected lien
   - Platform automatically alerts seller, pauses timeline
   - Creates task: "Resolve lien on property"
   - Shows resolution options (lien payoff, title insurance)
   - Once resolved, automatically resumes workflow

2. **Document Rejection**
   - Buyer uploads unsigned purchase agreement
   - Platform detects missing signature within seconds
   - Rejects document with clear explanation
   - Sends notification to buyer: "Action Required: Sign purchase agreement"
   - Buyer re-uploads, auto-approved, workflow continues

3. **Lender Condition**
   - Underwriting returns "approved with conditions"
   - Platform creates tasks for borrower
   - Tracks condition fulfillment
   - Auto-notifies lender when conditions met

**Key Components**:
```
/backend
  /services
    - notification_service.py (email, SMS via Twilio or mock)
    - exception_handler.py (routes issues to correct party)
    - task_manager.py (creates, assigns, tracks action items)
```

## Questions / Decisions Needed

1. **OCR Service**: Start with Tesseract (free) or AWS Textract (better quality)?
2. **Signature Verification**: Basic presence detection or advanced verification?
3. **E-signature**: Show native capability or assume documents arrive pre-signed?
4. **State Requirements**: Single state (generic) or demonstrate multi-state awareness?
5. **Frontend Framework**: Streamlit (fastest) or React (more polished)?
6. **Database**: PostgreSQL (production-like) or SQLite (portable demo)?
7. **Deployment**: Local Docker only or also prepare cloud deploy (Heroku/Railway)?
